# pi-arr — system inventory
 
Reference snapshot of the media server as built. Last updated: 2026-06-23.
Secrets (VPN keys, app passwords/API keys) are intentionally **not** stored here — they
live in the gluetun environment and each app's config volume.
 
---
 
## Host
 
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Device | Raspberry Pi 5, 8 GB RAM, active cooling + official M.2 HAT+ |
| Storage | Single NVMe — Micron MTFDKCD512QGN-1BN1AABLA, ~477 GiB. Holds OS **and** all data. No second disk. **QLC NAND, DRAM-less (HMB)** (Micron 2500-family, 232-layer QLC) — value drive: write speed/endurance degrade as it fills (pSLC cache shrinks), so keep extra free headroom. |
| OS | Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Bookworm, 64-bit / aarch64), kernel 6.12.75+rpt-rpi-2712 |
| Hostname | `pi-arr` |
| Primary user | `george` (UID 1000, GID 1000) |
| Boot | NVMe-first (`BOOT_ORDER=0xf461`), EEPROM updated |
| Timezone | Europe/Athens (host clock was found on `Europe/London` 2026-06-19 and corrected with `timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Athens`; UTC instant was always correct, only display/stamping was off) |
 
### Networking
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Office LAN (current) | 10.0.1.0/24 — Pi at **10.0.1.59** |
| Home LAN (after move) | 10.0.69.0/24 |
| Tailscale (host-level) | **100.115.36.108** — location-independent; use this for all access |
 
---
 
## Host-level installs (apt / scripts)
 
- **Docker Engine** — installed via the get.docker.com convenience script. `george`
  added to the `docker` group.
- **Tailscale** — installed on the host (not containerized).
- **restic + rclone** — host binaries for the off-box config backup (see **Backups** below).
  Deliberately not containerized, so the backup survives a wedged Docker daemon.
- **msmtp** (1.8.28) — host SMTP sender for the low-disk-space CRITICAL alert (see
  **Low-disk-space alert** below). Host-level on purpose, so it can mail even when Docker is
  wedged. `msmtp-mta` installed too (provides a `sendmail` symlink). AppArmor profile **declined**
  at install (the module is disabled on this host anyway — `/sys/module/apparmor/parameters/enabled`
  = `N`); avoided so a confinement rule can't silently block the alert path.
- (Pi firmware/EEPROM tooling is part of Pi OS; `rpi-imager` was used only on a separate
  bootstrap drive during install and is not part of the running server.)
---
 
## Portainer (standalone container, not a stack)
 
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Image | `portainer/portainer-ce:latest` |
| Run | `docker run` (not a compose stack) |
| Ports | 8000 (agent tunnel), 9443 (HTTPS UI) |
| Volume | `portainer_data:/data` + `/var/run/docker.sock` |
| Restart | always |
| Logging | json-file, `--log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3` (set 2026-06-19; standalone container can't take a stack `logging:` block, so the caps are run-flags — re-add them if ever recreated) |
 
---
 
## Stack: `media`
 
All download/indexer apps share gluetun's network namespace
(`network_mode: "service:gluetun"`) and exit through AirVPN. Jellyfin and Jellyseerr are
user-facing and stay **off** the VPN.
 
### gluetun (VPN + kill switch)
- Image: `qmcgaw/gluetun:latest`
- `cap_add: NET_ADMIN`, `devices: /dev/net/tun`
- Env:
  - `VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=airvpn`, `VPN_TYPE=wireguard`
  - `WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY` / `WIREGUARD_PRESHARED_KEY` / `WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES` (from AirVPN Config Generator)
  - `SERVER_COUNTRIES=Netherlands,Bulgaria,Belgium,Romania,Switzerland` (2026-06-19: widened
    from `Netherlands` so AirVPN can rotate exits without faulting the VPN monitor; current
    observed exit still Lelystad, NL — `213.152.186.116`. NB: as of 2026-06-22 the VPN monitor
    no longer asserts exit country — it's a liveness check (gluetun container health), decoupled
    from this list so the set can change freely. See **Stack: `monitoring`** → gluetun monitor.)
  - `FIREWALL_VPN_INPUT_PORTS=17159` (AirVPN forwarded port, reserved in AirVPN panel for all devices)
  - `FIREWALL_OUTBOUND_SUBNETS=10.0.1.0/24,10.0.69.0/24,100.64.0.0/10` (office + home LAN + Tailscale; pre-loaded for the move)
  - `TZ=Europe/Athens`
- Volume: `/opt/arr/gluetun:/gluetun`
- **Published ports for the behind-VPN apps** (declared here, not on the apps themselves):
  8080 qBittorrent · 9696 Prowlarr · 8989 Sonarr · 7878 Radarr · 6767 Bazarr.
  FlareSolverr (8191) is **not** published — internal only.
### qBittorrent
- Image: `lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest`
- `network_mode: "service:gluetun"`, PUID/PGID 1000, `WEBUI_PORT=8080`
- Volumes: `/opt/arr/qbittorrent:/config`, `/data/torrents:/data/torrents`
- **Critical in-app settings:**
  - Listening port = **17159**; "Use UPnP/NAT-PMP" = **OFF**
  - Advanced → Network Interface = **`tun0`**; bind to **All IPv4 addresses**
    (this fixed DHT=0 / stuck-on-metadata / firewalled — do not revert to "Any interface")
  - DHT / PeX / LSD = on; anonymous mode = off; encryption = allowed
  - Default save path `/data/torrents`
  - Download categories: Sonarr uses `tv-sonarr`, Radarr uses `radarr`
  - **Seeding limits (2026-06-19):** remove torrent **and its files** at ratio 2 OR 2 weeks
    (20160 min) total seeding, whichever first — the reclaim lever for watched-and-deleted
    titles. Hardlink-safe for arr-imported titles (library copy survives); a manually-added,
    never-imported torrent lives only in `/data/torrents`, so removal deletes its sole copy.
  - **Pre-allocate disk space for all files = ON (2026-06-19):** the in-app disk-full guard.
    On `ext4` (confirmed via `findmnt -no FSTYPE /`) this is a `fallocate` extent reservation,
    **not** a zero-fill, so **no extra write/wear** on the QLC drive. Reserves a torrent's full
    size at add-time, so an oversized grab onto a too-full disk **fails cleanly at the start**
    instead of dying mid-write (the worst failure mode on a single QLC disk). NB: this is
    fail-fast-at-overflow, **not** a free-space *threshold* guard — qBittorrent has **no**
    "pause when free space below X" setting (long-open upstream FRs #10098/#10645/#23572,
    unimplemented). So it complements, not replaces, the host `df` alert (roadmap #3): the
    `df` alert is the trend/headroom detector, pre-allocation is the clean-failure backstop at
    the exact moment of overflow. Verified working: adding a 2.9 GiB torrent moved `df` Used by
    the full size at add-time.
  - **`linux-iso` category — seeding exempt (2026-06-19):** distro ISOs (Ubuntu, Mint, Kali)
    kept seeded to give back to the projects, organised under a `linux-iso` category. These are
    the manually-added, never-imported case — sole copy lives in `/data/torrents`, no
    `/data/media` hardlink — so the global "remove + files" seeding limit would delete them.
    Exempted via a **per-torrent** share-limit override set to **no limit** (ratio and time), so
    the global rule never applies. NB: per-category share limits exist in qBittorrent's data
    model but the **WebUI can't edit them** (desktop GUI / `categories.json` only — confirmed on
    5.2.1), so the override is per-torrent; the category itself is organisational.
  - **Global upload rate limit = 15000 KiB/s (~half of the 250 Mbit up line, 2026-06-19):** not
    there to protect other devices — the upstream **Flint 2 router runs QoS** with VPN/proxy at
    its lowest of three tiers, so seeding already yields to calls/gaming under contention. The
    cap does the two things QoS structurally can't: (1) bufferbloat insurance (strict priority
    reorders packets but doesn't keep the upstream buffer shallow — Flint 2 SQM would, but it
    can't run alongside QoS), and (2) protects **our own downloads**, which ride the same
    WireGuard tunnel and so land in the same lowest QoS tier — nothing but qBittorrent arbitrates
    seed-vs-grab inside the tunnel, so capping upload keeps seeding from choking incoming ACKs.
    Download limit left unlimited. (WireGuard adds a few % overhead, so real WAN upload sits just
    above the cap.)
### Prowlarr
- Image: `lscr.io/linuxserver/prowlarr:latest`
- `network_mode: "service:gluetun"`, PUID/PGID 1000
- Volume: `/opt/arr/prowlarr:/config`
- FlareSolverr added as an indexer proxy at `http://localhost:8191`, tagged; tag applied
  to indexers needing Cloudflare bypass. Syncs indexers to Sonarr/Radarr as "Apps."
### Sonarr / Radarr
- Images: `lscr.io/linuxserver/sonarr:latest`, `lscr.io/linuxserver/radarr:latest`
- `network_mode: "service:gluetun"`, PUID/PGID 1000
- Volumes: `/opt/arr/<app>:/config`, `/data:/data`
- Download client: qBittorrent at host `localhost`, port `8080` (shared namespace)
- Root folders: `/data/media/tv` (Sonarr), `/data/media/movies` (Radarr)
- **Quality intent:** 1080p only (WEB-DL/WEBRip/HDTV/Bluray-1080p); **no** Remux or 2160p;
  size caps in quality definitions (~3–5 GB/hr) to exclude bloated encodes; custom format
  nudging H.264/x264 positive for direct-play. Delete after watching; preload full
  seasons / complete series / movie-sequel collections for binge (tag to keep).
### Bazarr
- Image: `lscr.io/linuxserver/bazarr:latest`
- `network_mode: "service:gluetun"`, PUID/PGID 1000
- Volume: `/opt/arr/bazarr:/config`, `/data/media:/data/media`
- Connected to Sonarr/Radarr. Language profile: Greek + English, **at least one**
  required (cutoff satisfied by either), not both forced.
- Connected to Sonarr/Radarr. One language profile: Greek + English, both required — 
  Cutoff left empty (no named "None" in this build; you deselect to clear it), so Bazarr never stops at one language and fetches both el + en. 
  Set as default for Series + Movies and reassigned to existing items. (2026-06-20: changed from "either satisfies.")
- Gotchas banked: cutoff any stops at the first language found (one-or-the-other); 
  a single-language cutoff locks to that one — empty is the only setting that forces both. 
  And two separate single-language profiles do not stack: each title takes exactly one profile, so that route yields one-or-the-other, not both.
### FlareSolverr
- Image: `ghcr.io/flaresolverr/flaresolverr:latest`
- `network_mode: "service:gluetun"` (must share gluetun's IP so Cloudflare clearance
  matches the indexer query IP)
- Env: `LOG_LEVEL=info`, `TZ=Europe/Athens`. **No** PUID/PGID (image doesn't use them).
- Memory-hungriest container (spawns Chromium per request); fine on 8 GB.
### Jellyfin (NOT behind VPN)
- Image: `lscr.io/linuxserver/jellyfin:latest`
- PUID/PGID 1000, port **8096**
- Volumes: `/opt/arr/jellyfin:/config`, `/data/media:/data/media:ro`
- No hardware transcoding (Pi 5 has no HW encoder). Configured/used for **direct play** —
  set clients to Original quality.
- **`.keep` sentinel files at each library root** (`/data/media/movies/.keep`,
  `/data/media/tv/.keep`, added 2026-06-26): keep the library folders from ever being
  *completely* empty. Jellyfin's scanner **skips an empty library root and won't prune**
  deleted titles (empty-folder safety guard — treats zero-items as a possibly-unmounted
  volume, to avoid wiping the library on a mount failure). The consume-and-delete model
  drains libraries to zero regularly, so without the sentinel a drained library keeps showing
  ghost entries no matter how often the scan runs. Dotfile → not parsed as media. Created
  host-side (`/data/media` is rw there; the container mount is `:ro`). See ISSUES.md #2.
- **Library reconciler = the scheduled `Scan Media Library` task**, not real-time monitoring
  (inotify is unreliable for deletions over bind mounts). Deletions surface on the next
  scheduled scan — given the `.keep` sentinel above, which is what makes that reliable on the
  empty-folder edge case.  
### Jellyseerr (NOT behind VPN)
- Image: `fallenbagel/jellyseerr:latest`
- Env: `LOG_LEVEL=info`, `TZ=Europe/Athens`. Port **5055**. Runs internally as uid 1000.
- Volume: `/opt/arr/jellyseerr:/app/config`
- Service connections (entered in Jellyseerr setup):
  - Jellyfin → `http://jellyfin:8096`
  - Radarr → `http://gluetun:7878`
  - Sonarr → `http://gluetun:8989`
  - (Sonarr/Radarr reached via the **gluetun** container name + their API keys, since they
    have no network identity of their own.)
- Uses built-in TMDB integration — no user-supplied TMDB key.
---
 
## Stack: `monitoring`
 
### Glances (live metrics)
- Image: `nicolargo/glances:latest`
- `network_mode: host`, `pid: host`, `GLANCES_OPT=-w` (web mode)
- Volumes: `/var/run/docker.sock:ro`, `/:/host:ro`
- Web UI on **61208**. Shows CPU, RAM, temperatures, disk usage/IO, per-process.
### Scrutiny (drive SMART health)
- Image: `ghcr.io/analogj/scrutiny:master-omnibus`
- `cap_add: SYS_RAWIO` **and** `SYS_ADMIN` (SYS_ADMIN required to read the NVMe SMART
  health log — without it temperature/power-on come back empty and status shows "Failed")
- Port **8082:8080**
- Devices: `/dev/nvme0n1`, `/dev/nvme0`
- Volumes: `/opt/scrutiny/config`, `/opt/scrutiny/influxdb`, `/run/udev:ro`
- Note: if device status reads "Failed" while all attributes are green, it's a stale
  record — trash the device in the UI and re-run `scrutiny-collector-metrics run`.
- **Notifications (active):** email via Gmail, set in `/opt/scrutiny/config/scrutiny.yaml`
  under `notify.urls`. Scrutiny shells out to **shoutrrr**, so the value is a shoutrrr SMTP
  URL:
  `smtp://<user>%40gmail.com:<app-password>@smtp.gmail.com:587/?fromAddress=<user>@gmail.com&toAddresses=<user>%2Bpiarr@gmail.com&fromName=pi-arr&encryption=ExplicitTLS&usestarttls=yes`
  - Gmail needs an **app password** (2FA on); the normal password is rejected over SMTP.
  - **URL-encode the userinfo:** `@`→`%40` in the username (an unescaped `@` gives a
    `net/url: invalid userinfo` parse error and the container **restart-loops**); `+`→`%2B`
    in the plus-addressed recipient.
  - `fromName=pi-arr` makes alerts self-identify per box; `+piarr` enables Gmail filtering.
  - The yaml is `chmod 600` (holds the app password); the container runs as root, so it can
    still read it. Keys in `notify.urls` query string (`fromAddress`/`toAddresses`) keep a
    literal `@` — only the userinfo before `@host` needs encoding.
  - Test: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/health/notify`. **A `{"success":true}`
    response is NOT proof of delivery** — confirm by inbox; on failure read the container
    logs for the `Sending notifications to smtp://…` line (shows the real auth/parse error).
  - **`notify.level` is removed in this image.** It moved to the web UI; a stray `level:` key
    fails config validation and restart-loops the container (this bit us once). Current UI
    settings: **Device Status Threshold = Both**, **Notify Filter Attributes = All** — the
    most-sensitive pairing = earliest warning, the right call on a single-disk SPOF.
### Uptime Kuma (service up/down monitoring)
- Image: `louislam/uptime-kuma:2` — pinned to the **v2 major** (gets patches, no surprise v3
  jump; arm64 supported). Added to the `monitoring` stack alongside Glances + Scrutiny.
- Port **3001:3001**; volumes `/opt/uptime-kuma:/app/data` (SQLite `kuma.db` + history) **and**
  `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro` (added 2026-06-22 for the gluetun Docker
  Container monitor — see below). `restart: unless-stopped`. First-run DB choice = **SQLite**
  (right for a handful of monitors on one box; MariaDB is for large deployments and only adds
  failure surface here). **NB on the socket:** it grants Kuma full Docker-daemon control (the
  `:ro` flag locks the socket *file*, not the API — not a real safeguard); acceptable here only
  because Kuma is never published to the WAN (Tailscale/LAN only) and Portainer already mounts it.
- **Monitor addressing:** Uptime Kuma is a bridge container, so `localhost` means *itself*,
  not the Pi. All HTTP monitors target the **Tailscale host IP** `http://100.115.36.108:<port>`
  — location-independent (survives the office→home move), and it's also how the VPN-gated apps
  are reached (they're published on the host by gluetun, so from here they're just host ports).
  Probe-verified against Jellyfin before building the rest.
- **HTTP(s) monitors (7):**
  - Jellyfin → `:8096/health` · Jellyseerr → `:5055`
  - qBittorrent → `:8080` · Bazarr → `:6767`
  - Prowlarr → `:9696/ping` · Sonarr → `:8989/ping` · Radarr → `:7878/ping`
    (`/ping` = unauthenticated 200 health check; if a URL base is set and `/ping` 404s, drop
    it for the bare base URL, which also returns 200)
  - **FlareSolverr (8191) excluded** — internal-only, never published, unreachable from
    outside gluetun's namespace; its health is implied by Prowlarr working.
- **Per-monitor retries = 2** (v2 defaults *new* monitors to 0, so a single blip would fire an
  alert). Interval left at 60 s.
- **gluetun-namespace signature:** the five VPN-gated apps share gluetun's namespace, so a
  gluetun drop shows as **all five going red at once** — read that as "gluetun," not five
  separate faults. A *direct* gluetun check also exists via the **`pi-arr gluetun (VPN)`** Docker
  Container monitor (see below), so the all-five-red pattern remains the in-Kuma tell while the
  container-health monitor adds the dedicated signal (retired roadmap #2's loose end via #8).
- **Notifications:** Email (SMTP) via the same Gmail, set in Settings → Notifications. Uptime
  Kuma uses its **own** SMTP client (nodemailer) via a plain form — **not** a shoutrrr URL, so
  **no URL-encoding** (literal `@`, no `%40`). Hostname `smtp.gmail.com`, port **587**,
  Security **STARTTLS**, username/From/To = the Gmail address, password = the app password.
  - **"Apply on all existing monitors" must be ON** — otherwise the channel attaches to no
    monitors and nothing ever emails (silent gap). "Default Enabled" ON so new monitors inherit
    it.
  - Custom Subject/Body left **blank** (default names the monitor + status). v2 templating is
    **LiquidJS** (lowercase `{{ name }}`, `{{ status }}`); the old uppercase `{{STATUS}}`-style
    placeholders render as literal text — avoid.
- **Push monitor `pi-arr disk space` (added 2026-06-19):** the WARN half of the low-disk-space
  alert (roadmap #3). Monitor Type = **Push**; the host script (`pi-arr-disk-alert.sh`) pushes
  `up`/`down` with a free-space message each run. Kuma has **no native host-disk monitor** (that
  FR was closed as not-planned), so Push is the mechanism. **Heartbeat Interval = 1800 s**,
  deliberately 2× the script's 15-min timer cadence: long enough not to flap on one missed run,
  short enough that a *dead script* flips it `Down` (so the alerter's own death surfaces). Uses
  the same Gmail notification channel as the others (so the WARN email needs no new secret).
- **Docker Container monitor `pi-arr gluetun (VPN)` (added 2026-06-22, replaced the
  `pi-arr vpn exit` Push monitor):** the dedicated gluetun/VPN check (roadmap #8). Monitor
  Type = **Docker Container**, Container Name = `gluetun`, via a Docker Host (connection type
  **Socket**, `/var/run/docker.sock`) registered in Kuma's settings. Reads gluetun's
  `State.Health.Status` — i.e. gluetun's own active egress healthcheck (ICMP/DNS every minute,
  TCP+TLS dial every 5 min through the tunnel), so "green" means real tunnel egress worked
  recently, not merely that the container is running. **Liveness only — no country assertion**
  (decoupled from `SERVER_COUNTRIES`; the country/leak check was dropped 2026-06-22). Interval
  60 s, **Retries = 2** (v2 still defaults new monitors to 0 — the silent-no-alert trap); same
  Gmail channel (no new secret). **Why this needs v2:** Kuma counts a running, healthchecked
  container `up` *only* when health = `healthy`, else `down` (PR #4372); v1 reported unhealthy as
  *pending* and never alerted.
---
 
## Stack: `dashboard`
 
Homepage (`gethomepage`) landing dashboard — a single info strip + service tiles for the whole
box. Added 2026-06-23. **Socket-free by decision:** no `docker.sock` mount — it uses service
widgets + ping, **not** container discovery (so it never gets Docker-daemon control, unlike
Kuma/Portainer). Authoring source for the compose + the two config YAMLs is in this repo under
`dashboard/` (see `dashboard/README.md`); on the box the stack lives in Portainer and the YAMLs
live in `/opt/homepage`.
 
### Homepage
- Image: `ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest` (arm64 supported). New Portainer stack `dashboard`,
  single service.
- `PUID/PGID=1000`, `TZ=Europe/Athens`, `restart: unless-stopped`, the shared log cap
  (`json-file`, `max-size: 10m`, `max-file: 3`).
- Port **3000:3000** (verified free on the host first).
- Volume `/opt/homepage:/app/config`, owned `1000:1000`. YAML-only (no DB).
- **`HOMEPAGE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (required — Homepage refuses connections without it):**
  comma-separated `host:port`, no spaces. Currently `100.115.36.108:3000,10.0.1.59:3000`
  (Tailscale + current LAN); **add `10.0.69.x:3000` after the office→home move.**
- **Addressing rule (every widget + link):** `http://100.115.36.108:<port>` — Tailscale host IP,
  **never** container names, and **no trailing slash** (a trailing `/` breaks widgets — the #1
  cause of "API Error").
- **Secrets:** kept out of the YAML via Homepage's env-var substitution — values injected as
  `HOMEPAGE_VAR_*` (stack env) and referenced as `{{HOMEPAGE_VAR_NAME}}`. They live only on the
  box (Portainer stack env). If ever inlined instead, `chmod 600` the YAMLs like the Scrutiny one.
### `widgets.yaml` (top info strip)
- **Glances** info widget at `http://100.115.36.108:61208`, showing `cpu`, `mem`, `cputemp`,
  `disk: /`. The `version` field **must match the running Glances major version** (required for
  v4+, defaults to 3 if omitted) — set per the container, don't assume.
- A **datetime** widget.
### `services.yaml` groups
- **Media** — Jellyfin (`type: jellyfin`, **new** API key created in Jellyfin → Dashboard →
  Advanced → API Keys), Jellyseerr (`type: jellyseerr`, key from Settings → General).
- **Acquisition** — qBittorrent (`type: qbittorrent`, WebUI **username + password**, not a key),
  Sonarr/Radarr (`type: sonarr`/`radarr`, existing API keys), Prowlarr + Bazarr as plain links
  with a `ping` status dot. (NB: `ping` targets the host IP, so it confirms the Pi is reachable,
  not the app itself — all the VPN-gated apps share this one published host IP.)
- **Operations** — Uptime Kuma rollup (`type: uptimekuma`, `url: …:3001`, `slug:` = the published
  status-page slug, `fields: ["up","down","uptime","incident"]`), Scrutiny (`type: scrutiny`,
  `url: …:8082`, no key), Portainer as a link.
### Kuma prerequisite
- A single **published** Uptime Kuma status page backs the rollup tile: all monitors (7 HTTP + the
  `pi-arr gluetun (VPN)` Docker-Container monitor + the `pi-arr disk space` Push monitor) in one
  group; the tile reads that page via its slug.

## Logging / log rotation (all containers)
 
Per-service log caps so container logs can't fill the root partition (roadmap #3, 2026-06-19).
Chose compose-level `logging:` over `/etc/docker/daemon.json` deliberately — see the gotcha below.
 
- **Both stacks:** a shared YAML anchor at the top of each compose, with `logging: *default-logging`
  on every service:
  ```yaml
  x-logging: &default-logging
    driver: json-file
    options:
      max-size: "10m"
      max-file: "3"
  ```
- **Portainer (standalone):** can't take a stack `logging:` block, so the same caps are
  `docker run` flags (`--log-opt max-size=10m --log-opt max-file=3`) — see the Portainer table.
- Result: all 14 containers cap at 10 MB × 3 = 30 MB each (~420 MB worst case).
- **Why not `daemon.json`:** (1) daemon log-opts apply only to **newly created** containers and
  need a full **daemon restart** to load — and a daemon restart force-cycles gluetun, with the
  namespace apps **not** ordered by `depends_on` (that's Compose-only, not honoured on daemon
  restart / reboot). (2) `daemon.json` is a host file **outside the restic backup set**, so the
  caps wouldn't survive a bare-metal restore; per-service `logging:` lives in the backed-up
  compose. Applying it was a normal Portainer stack redeploy (compose changed → services

## Low-disk-space alert (host-level)
 
Dual-layer free-space alert on `/` (single filesystem — OS + all data). Roadmap #3, 2026-06-19.
Host script + systemd timer, mirroring the backup machinery; decoupled from Docker on purpose.
 
- **Script:** `/usr/local/sbin/pi-arr-disk-alert.sh` (root, 700). Measures free GB on `/` via
  `df -B1` (byte-exact, no column-counting), then branches:
  - **OK** (> 90 G free) → push `up` heartbeat to Kuma.
  - **WARN** (≤ 90 G, ~19% free) → push `down` to Kuma → WARN email via Kuma's channel.
  - **CRITICAL** (≤ 35 G, ~7.5% free) → push `down` to Kuma **and** send a host email via
    **msmtp** (subject `[pi-arr] CRITICAL: low disk space`). Both channels fire at CRIT.
  - Thresholds are constants at the top of the script. Set conservatively for the **QLC** drive
    (keep headroom — see Host → Storage). Each send helper ends in `|| echo … >&2` so a failure
    in one channel never aborts the run (and never suppresses the other) under `set -e`.
- **Timer:** `pi-arr-disk-alert.timer` → `pi-arr-disk-alert.service` (oneshot), every **15 min**
  (`OnBootSec=5min`, `OnUnitActiveSec=15min`, `Persistent=true`). The service depends on
  `network-online.target` but **deliberately NOT** `docker.service` — the msmtp path must fire
  even when Docker is wedged.
- **msmtp:** config at `/etc/msmtprc` (root, **600**) → `smtp.gmail.com:587`, STARTTLS, Gmail
  **app password** (this is the **third** on-box copy of that password — see auth map).
  `logfile /var/log/msmtp.log`. `From: pi-arr <…>`, `To: …+piarr@gmail.com` (threads/filters with
  the other pi-arr mail). NB: a zero exit is **not** proof of delivery — confirm by inbox / the
  log's `250` line, same lesson as the Scrutiny test.
- **Kuma side:** the `pi-arr disk space` Push monitor, heartbeat 1800 s (see Uptime Kuma section).
- **Verified** by a real fill-test (`fallocate` on `/`) crossing WARN then CRITICAL on genuine
  `df` output — both channels confirmed, then fillers removed and space reclaimed to baseline.

## VPN exit check — retired 2026-06-22 (now a Kuma Docker Container monitor)
 
The host-level VPN exit check (script `pi-arr-vpn-check.sh` + systemd timer + Kuma Push monitor,
roadmap #8) was **removed 2026-06-22**. It joined a throwaway `curlimages/curl` container to
gluetun's namespace, queried `ipinfo.io`, and asserted the exit country. Why it was replaced:
- **Throttling:** AirVPN's shared exit IP collectively blew ipinfo's unauthenticated limit
  (1,000 req/day, **per IP, shared across all users on that exit**), so the check intermittently
  got a 429 with no parseable country and false-flagged `down` ("egress OK but no country").
- **Country coupling:** asserting the exit country tied the monitor to `SERVER_COUNTRIES`, which
  is meant to change freely.
 
Replaced by the **`pi-arr gluetun (VPN)` Docker Container monitor** (see **Stack: `monitoring`**
→ Uptime Kuma): it reads gluetun's own `State.Health.Status` via the Docker socket — the same
egress-liveness signal (gluetun's healthcheck actively pings/DNS-queries each minute and
TCP+TLS-dials every 5 min through the tunnel), with no external lookup, nothing to rate-limit,
and gluetun never touched. **Dropped in the swap:** the country/leak assertion — liveness only
now. **Deleted:** `/usr/local/sbin/pi-arr-vpn-check.sh`,
`/etc/systemd/system/pi-arr-vpn-check.{service,timer}`, the embedded Kuma push token (died with
the script), and the pre-pulled `curlimages/curl` image.

## Backups — off-box config snapshots
 
Encrypted, deduplicated snapshots of the **config** (not media) to **Google Drive**, run by a
host-level systemd timer as **root**. Decoupled from Docker on purpose (survives a wedged
daemon). Roadmap item #1; restore verified to scratch and over live.
 
### Tooling (host binaries, not containers)
- **restic** 0.18.0, repo format v2 / compressed — `apt install` then `restic self-update`.
- **rclone** (official install script, current arm64) — provides the Drive backend; restic
  has no native Drive backend and shells out to rclone (`rclone:<remote>:<path>`).
### Repository
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Backend | Google Drive via rclone remote `gdrive` |
| Scope | `drive.file` — least privilege; rclone sees **only files it created**, not the rest of the Drive |
| OAuth | own Google Cloud client (Desktop app), **published to production** (Testing mode expires tokens after 7 days) |
| Repo | `rclone:gdrive:rclone/restic-pi-arr` (ID `bd9ae25b`) |
 
### What's captured
- `/opt/arr` — all app configs.
- `/opt/homepage` — the Homepage dashboard config (YAML-only). **Added to the include set
  2026-06-23** when the `dashboard` stack was built — it sits outside `/opt/arr`, so it had to be
  added explicitly to the script's path list or it wouldn't be captured. `--group-by host`
  retention absorbs the changed path-set automatically. YAML-only (no DB), so it does **not** join
  the pre-backup container-stop list — safe to snapshot live.
- `/var/lib/docker/volumes/portainer_data/_data` — the Portainer volume, which holds the
  **stack definitions** at `compose/<id>/docker-compose.yml`. Because the compose was pasted
  into Portainer's editor, the gluetun **WireGuard secret is inline in there** — this is the
  crown jewel. `/opt/arr` + these compose files rebuild the box on a fresh Portainer without
  needing Portainer's own DB.
- **Excluded:** `/opt/arr/jellyfin/cache` (~5.9 GB of regenerable transcodes — see ISSUES.md #1).
### Schedule & consistency
- `pi-arr-backup.timer` → `pi-arr-backup.service` (oneshot) → `/usr/local/sbin/pi-arr-backup.sh`.
- Fires `*-*-* 04:00` Athens, `RandomizedDelaySec=15min`, `Persistent=true` (runs a missed
  backup after downtime).
- For a mid-write-safe snapshot the script **stops the eight app containers** (bazarr,
  qbittorrent, sonarr, radarr, prowlarr, jellyfin, jellyseerr, portainer), backs up, then
  restarts them. **gluetun is left running** — it has no DB and must never cycle (kill switch
  stays up; apps rejoin its namespace on restart). Downtime ≈ 30–60 s. A `trap` guarantees
  the apps restart even if the backup fails or the job is killed.
- Retention (run after restart; repo-only, no downtime): `forget --group-by host
  --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 4 --keep-monthly 12 --prune`. `--group-by host` keeps all
  pi-arr snapshots on one timeline regardless of path-set changes.
### Credentials — where they live
- **restic repo password** — the one unrecoverable secret. Master copy is **off-box** (in
  george's password manager); on-box at `/root/.config/restic/password` (root, 600) for
  unattended runs. That file is outside the backup set, so it never lands in the repo.
- **rclone configs — two independent copies, by necessity.** `/home/george/.config/rclone/`
  for interactive use; `/root/.config/rclone/` for the backup job. They must be separate
  because rclone **rewrites its config on every token refresh (~hourly)** — a shared file run
  under sudo gets chowned to root and locks george out. Both hold the same token; root's is
  the one the job depends on.
### Restore (disaster recovery)
On any machine with restic + rclone and the two secrets (repo password + an rclone config
carrying a valid token, or re-auth of the same OAuth client):
 
```bash
sudo RCLONE_CONFIG=/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf \
  restic -r rclone:gdrive:rclone/restic-pi-arr \
  --password-file /root/.config/restic/password \
  restore <snapshot-id> --target <path>
```
 
`--target /` restores in place (stop the apps first; add `--exclude /opt/arr/gluetun` while
the VPN is running). Recreate the two stacks from the restored compose files, restore
`/opt/arr` alongside.
 
### Gotchas banked
- **A `drive.file` repo is visible only to the token that created it** — every restic/rclone
  op must use a config carrying that token, or the repo appears not to exist.
- **`sudo restic` uses *root's* default rclone config**, not george's — point it with
  `RCLONE_CONFIG=` (the script exports this).
- **Restore over live defaults to overwrite, not delete** — changed files revert, newer extra
  files are left in place. Use `--delete` only after a `--dry-run` (and it requires an
  `--include`/`--exclude` when `--target /`).
- **Still unrehearsed:** zero-to-restored on *bare metal* (fresh box, nothing but the repo +
  the two passwords). The mechanism is proven; the from-scratch drill is the final check.

```
- `/data` and its subtrees are owned `1000:1000`.
- Downloads and media live on the **same filesystem** so Sonarr/Radarr move grabs by
  hardlink (no double-write, no extra space). Keep this property if storage is ever added.
  **Verified 2026-06-19:** an imported title shows the **same inode** under both
  `/data/torrents` and `/data/media` with **link count 2** (checked via
  `find /data/media -links +1` then `find /data/torrents -inum <inode>`) — one physical
  file, two names. This is what makes the qBittorrent "remove torrent + files" seeding limit
  safe for arr-imported titles: it drops the torrent's link, and the library copy survives.

## API keys / auth map (where to find them)
 
- qBittorrent: authenticated by **WebUI username/password** (no API key).
- Each *arr app's API key: app → Settings → General. Used by:
  - Prowlarr → Sonarr & Radarr
  - Bazarr → Sonarr & Radarr
  - Jellyseerr → Sonarr & Radarr
  - Homepage → Sonarr & Radarr (read-only widget queries; reuses the existing keys)
- **Jellyfin API key (Homepage)** — a **new** key created in Jellyfin → Dashboard → Advanced →
  API Keys for the Homepage `jellyfin` widget (the box's first Jellyfin API key; Jellyseerr uses
  Jellyfin's auth, not an API key). Revoke/regenerate from the same screen.
- **Homepage widget secrets** — Jellyfin/Jellyseerr/Sonarr/Radarr keys + the qBittorrent WebUI
  username/password are kept out of the YAML via env-var substitution: injected as `HOMEPAGE_VAR_*`
  through the `dashboard` Portainer stack env and referenced as `{{HOMEPAGE_VAR_NAME}}` in
  `/opt/homepage/services.yaml`. They live only on the box (Portainer stack env). No new external
  credential — they're copies/uses of keys already documented above.
- VPN credentials: in the gluetun service environment (WireGuard keys/addresses).
- Notification email (Scrutiny + Uptime Kuma + host msmtp): a Gmail **app password** (2FA
  enabled). Three on-box copies, by necessity: inline in the shoutrrr URL in
  `/opt/scrutiny/config/scrutiny.yaml` (Scrutiny); in Uptime Kuma's SQLite DB
  (`/opt/uptime-kuma/kuma.db`); and in `/etc/msmtprc` (root, 600) for the host low-disk-space
  CRITICAL alert. Master copy in george's password manager. Revoke/rotate via Google Account →
  Security → App passwords (rotating means updating all three on-box copies).
- Backup secrets (restic repo password, rclone OAuth token): see **Backups → Credentials** above.
- **Uptime Kuma push token** — the `pi-arr disk space` Push monitor has a token embedded in its
  host script (`pi-arr-disk-alert.sh`, root/700). Not a credential to any external service — the
  token only lets a local caller post heartbeats to that one monitor — but kept out of
  world-readable files all the same. Regenerate from the monitor's page in Uptime Kuma if ever
  needed. (The former `pi-arr vpn exit` monitor's token was retired with that monitor on
  2026-06-22 — see **VPN exit check — retired**.)
